  <h2>About MyLibrary</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>MyLibrary</strong> is a digital library management system designed to
    simplify the process of managing books and user interactions in a library
    environment. The system provides an efficient and user-friendly way to
    browse, issue, and track books using modern web technologies.
  </p>
  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    MyLibrary is developed as a frontend-only web application using
    <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. Instead of a backend database,
    the application uses <strong>localStorage</strong> to store user data,
    book information, and issued book records. This makes the system lightweight,
    fast, and easy to deploy.
